======================================================
AnalogIn for single-ended and
differential ADC readings.

* Author(s): Brent Rubell

.. note:: The ADC chips' input pins (AKA "channels") are aliased in this library as integer
    variables whose names start with "P". Each module that contains a driver class for a
    particular ADC chip (in this library) has these aliases predefined accordingly. This is done
    for code readability and prevention of erroneous SPI commands. The following example code
    explains this best:

    .. code-block:: python

        >>> import adafruit_mcp3xxx.mcp3008 as MCP
        >>> print('channel', MCP.P0)
        channel 0
        >>> print('channel', MCP.P7)
        channel 7
        >>> print('channel', MCP.P8)
        Traceback (most recent call last):
          File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
        AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'P8'
"""

from .mcp3xxx import MCP3xxx

class AnalogIn():
    """AnalogIn Mock Implementation for ADC Reads.

    :param ~mcp3002.MCP3002,~mcp3004.MCP3004,~mcp3008.MCP3008 mcp: The mcp object.
    :param int positive_pin: Required pin for single-ended.
    :param int negative_pin: Optional pin for differential reads.

    .. important::
        The ADC chips supported by this library do not handle negative numbers when returning the
        differential read of 2 channels. If the resulting differential read is less than 0, the
        returned integer is ``0``. If for some reason the voltage on a channel is greater than the
        reference voltage (Vin) or less than 0, then the returned integer is ``65472â€¬`` or ``0``
        (applies to single ended and differential reads).

        It is also worth noting that the differential reads (comparisons done by the ADC chip) are
        limited to certain pairs of channels. Please refer to the driver class of your ADC chip for
        a list of available differential mappings (comparisons). Otherwise, it is recommended to
        compute the differences between single-ended reads of separate channels for more flexible
        results.
